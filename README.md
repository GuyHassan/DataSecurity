# Data Security Project

This project was created in conjunction with the three college classmates.

The project focuses on a data mining deep search of user names and passwords for any type (the project write for a security camera but its not diffrent) of device(with a default user name and password),
the search is done on random sites, we put a website into the software and it starts searching for more and more sites from the site we entered,
in the end the software brings us a document with all the data he found.
